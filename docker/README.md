We provide a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) based REST-API for EasyNMT: Send a query with your source text, and the API returns the translated text.

## Usage


## Documentation

To get an overview of all REST API endpoints, with all possible parameters and their description, you open the following url:

```
http://localhost:24080/docs
```

If you have started it with a different port, replace `24080` with the port you chose.
